        <p style="font-size: 10px;">Homepage is the front page of your website — a destination where users land when typing your website URL address. It’s located at the root of the website’s domain (e.g., matomo.org) or a subdomain (e.g., university.webflow.com).

            Design-wise a homepage has two goals:
            
            Explain the purpose of the website and present overview information 
            Provide top-level navigation to lower-level web pages (e.g., blog, sales pages, etc.) 
            Separately, a homepage is also the place where users will return each time they’ll feel stuck and want to start anew. Thus, your homepage website design should provide obvious navigation paths to other website areas.
            
            6 Must-Know Website Homepage Design Best Practices
            Behind every winning homepage design stands a detailed customer journey map. 
            
            A customer journey is a schematic representation of how site visitors will move around your website to accomplish various goals. 
            
            A good customer journey map lists different actions a user will take after landing on your website (e.g., browse product pages, save items to a wishlist, register an account, etc.) — and it does so for different audience segments.
